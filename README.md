<h1>About the Ontology for General Medical Science</h1>
<i>You can get the OWL version of OGMS at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ogms.owl.</i>


The Ontology for General Medical Science (OGMS) is an ontology of entities involved in a clinical encounter.  OGMS includes very general terms that are used across medical disciplines, including: 'disease', 'disorder', 'disease course', 'diagnosis', 'patient', and 'healthcare provider'.  OGMS uses the <a href="http://www.ifomis.org/bfo/">Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)</a> as an upper-level ontology. The scope of OGMS is restricted to humans, but many terms can be applied to a variety of organisms.  OGMS provides a formal theory of disease that can be further elaborated by specific disease ontologies.  This theory is implemented using OWL-DL and <a href="http://obofoundry.org/ro/">OBO Relation Ontology</a> relations and is available in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/">OWL</a> and <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.format.obo-1_2.shtml">OBO</a> formats.

OGMS is based on the papers <a href="http://ontology.buffalo.edu/medo/Disease_and_Diagnosis.pdf">Toward an Ontological Treatment of Disease and Diagnosis</a> and <a href="http://ontology.buffalo.edu/bio/ISMB/ISMB_Bio-ontologies.pdf">On Carcinomas and Other Pathological Entities</a>. The ontology attempts to address some of the issues raised at the <a href="http://bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/Workshop_on_Ontology_of_Diseases">Workshop on Ontology of Diseases</a> (Dallas, TX) and the <a href="http://bimib.disco.unimib.it/index.php/SSFW09">Signs, Symptoms, and Findings Workshop</a>(Milan, Italy). OGMS was formerly called the clinical phenotype ontology. Terms from OGMS hang from the <a href="http://www.ifomis.org/bfo">Basic Formal Ontology</a>.

*NEWS*:
The OGMS-based Cardiovascular Disease Ontology was the winner of this year's Ontology Competition at the FOIS (Formal Ontology in Information Systems) conference in Rio de Janeiro.
