def: "A bodily process that is clinically abnormal." [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/medo/Disease_and_Diagnosis.pdf]
comment: Definition in paper: A bodily process that is a manifestation of a disorder. However, disorders are not realizables and, thus, are not manifested. The definition might be improved as "A bodily process that is a manifestation of a disease", but RS wants disease to cover the entire disposition, whereas a pathological process may just be a manifestation of one part of the overall disposition (i.e., just a partial manifestation of the disease). The term 'bodily' includes all biological scales (genetic, cellular, organ, organism) involving parts of an organism. RS: "a pathological process inherits its 'abnormal' properties from the definition of disorder. The one question that I have is - are all process that are realizations of a disease/disorder[sic] pathological processes, or are some physiological responses. If so, what are the differences? ".

comment: Elucidation: We use clinically abnormal to characterize those qualities of or in an organism that are (1) causally linked to an elevated risk of pain or other feelings of illness, to dysfunction, or to enhanced morbidity, and which (unlike pregnancy or menopause) are not such as to belong to the life plan for an organism of the relevant type. A clinician will judge a quality to be clinically abnormal only where the elevated risk exceeds a certain threshold level of clinical significance.
