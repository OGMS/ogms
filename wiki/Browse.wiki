An experimental tree browser for OGMS is available [http://ogms.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/web/ogms.html here]. Until a bug that prevents the whole tree to be visible initially is fixed, you probably want to command-click or right-click first thing, to get it to do so. Note that the viewer requires that java applets work in your browser. Email alanruttenberg@gmail.com if you have problems using it.
