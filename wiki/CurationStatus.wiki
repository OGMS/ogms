#summary The curation status of OGMS terms

Work in Progress.  Issues: Does metadata include DL restrictions?  Are these applicable only to the development version of OGMS (should we maintain a development version?)?  Can these be mirrored in the OBO format?

= Curation Status Annotations =

  * *example to be eventually removed*: (don't use, should all obsolete terms assigned this)
  * *metadata complete*: (safe to use)
  * *metadata incomplete* (use with caution, location in hierarchy may change or depends on suspect term)
  * *organizational term*: (use with caution, use subtype or other ogms type wherever possible)
  * *pending final vetting*: (safe to use)
  * *ready for release*: (safe to use)
  * *to be repalced with external ontology term*: (don't use)
  * *uncurated*: (don't use)
