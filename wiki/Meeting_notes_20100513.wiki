= Notes from OGMS meeting at FOIS (May 13, 2010) =

Action Items:
  # Fix 'syndrome'. Def: A pattern of signs and symptoms that typically co-occur.  Comment: Usually used for patterns with unknown etiology.  Note: AIDS and Down Syndrome are not syndromes in this sense.  
  # Pulse rate / Heart rate. Define 'arterial pulsation' =def a pumping of the artery.  Syn: pulse process, pulsation.  Define 'pulse' =def periodic differences in pressure due to arterial pulsation.
  # 'acute disease course' (sibling of 'transient disease course') defined as a disease course with a rapid onset but typical unfolding of signs and symptoms after this rapid onset.
  # stop using 'feature' throughout
  # inflammation process =def a process which is a response by an organism's tissues that is generally identified by swelling or localized pain. 
  # Disease classification by organ system (as are specialties in medicine).  Get rid of overlap between different disease types and 'genetic disease'.  'Genetic disease' may be the weakest link because it might just be a predisposition.
  # Children of 'etiological process' (maximal such process called 'etiology'): a process that gives rise to a disorder (syn: pathogenesis? Investigate this (cause + sequellum).  How to describe typical cases.)
