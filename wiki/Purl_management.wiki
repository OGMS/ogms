# Information about setting up and maintaining the purls.

= Adminstrative =

Setup is at http://purl.org/.

We use purl.obolibrary.org, which is a CNAME for purl.org, currently.

There is a purl "group" called "ogms". It currently has Alan(alanruttenberg) and Lindsay(lgcowell) as members. 

There is one purl currently - /obo/ogms.owl - the administators of that purl are the members of the ogms group.
