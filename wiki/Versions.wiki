_Describing snapshots for which date PURLs have been allocated_

= Policy =

We use the subversion repository to host files. Releases are named by date released YYYY-MM-DD and have tags of that form in the releases directory. Purls of the form `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ogms/YYYY-MM-DD/____.owl` are used to point to these tagged versions. The latest dated version is also pointed to by the ontology URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ogms.owl. 


= OGMS Ontology URI =

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ogms.owl 
 * OBO format version (but beware bogus BFO ids) http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ogms.obo 

Always points to latest dated version.

= OWL 1 usage =

Use the PURL for the version you want. Ignore any complaints from tools that the ontology URI doesn't match the physical URI

= OWL 2 usage =

Use http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ogms.owl as the ontologyIRI and the PURL for the version you want as the versionIRI.
